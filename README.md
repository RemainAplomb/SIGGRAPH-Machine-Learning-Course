# SIGGRAPH-Machine-Learning-Course


Name: Rahmani Dibansa

Description: This contains my understanding and outputs for the SIGGRAPH Machine Learning Course that
             spans 9 lectures. The Course delved into the introduction as well as implementation of 
             different kinds of machine learning models. This includes data gathering, preparation of data,
             building models, and training.

General Layout of the Lectures:
             Lecture 1: Introduction to the course, and discussion about AI & Machine Learning Concepts.
                        Gradient Descent, Linear Regression, and Activation Functions.
                        
             Lecture 2: Regression Neural Network, Classification Neural Network, and Visualization
             
             Lecture 3: Maximum Likelihood Estimation, and AutoEncoder
             
             Lecture 4: Data Pipeline, and Convolutional Neural Network
             
             Lecture 5: Convolutional Neural Network, and Denoising
             
             Lecture 6: Facial Recognition System, Variational AutoEncoders, and Transfer Learning
             
             Lecture 7: Variational AutoEncoder, and Generative Adversial Network
             
             Lecture 8: Recurrent Neural Network, and Generative Adversial Network
             
             Lecture 9: Reinforcement Learning, and Recurrent Neural Network
